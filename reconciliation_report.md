# Reconciliation Process Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details the testing and analysis of the reconciliation process of the application. The goal was to test the entire reconciliation process, focusing on the perfect case and on 5 edge cases, suggest improvements and find bottlenecks.

## 2. Testing Process

The testing process involved the following steps:

1.  **Environment Setup:** The required dependencies from `requirements.txt` were installed.
2.  **Test Data Preparation:** Two test files were created:
    *   `test_transactions.ofx`: Containing bank transactions for various test scenarios.
    *   `test_financial_entries.xlsx`: Containing corresponding company financial entries.
3.  **Execution:** A Python script was used to upload the test files to the application and trigger the reconciliation process.
4.  **Analysis:** The results of the reconciliation were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the matching algorithm and to identify any issues.

### 2.1. Test Cases

The following test cases were designed to cover a range of scenarios:

| Case                      | Bank Transaction Details                               | Company Entry Details                                  | Expected Outcome |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **Perfect Match**         | Amount: -100.00, Date: 2023-01-15, Desc: "Office Supplies" | Amount: 100.00, Date: 2023-01-15, Desc: "Office Supplies" | Match            |
| **Mismatched Amounts**    | Amount: -150.50, Date: 2023-01-16                      | Amount: 150.00, Date: 2023-01-16                       | Match            |
| **Mismatched Dates**      | Amount: -200.00, Date: 2023-01-20                      | Amount: 200.00, Date: 2023-01-18                       | Match            |
| **Dissimilar Descriptions** | Desc: "Online Purchase"                                | Desc: "E-commerce Shopping"                            | Match            |
| **One-to-Many Match**     | Amount: -500.00                                        | Amounts: 250.00, 250.00                                | No Match         |
| **No Match**              | Amount: -1000.00                                       | No corresponding entry                                 | No Match         |

## 3. Results

The reconciliation process was executed successfully after fixing some initial bugs in the XLSX parsing logic. The results for each test case are as follows:

| Case                      | Actual Outcome | Match Score | Analysis                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perfect Match**         | **Match**      | 0.94        | The transaction was matched with a high score, as expected.                                                                           |
| **Mismatched Amounts**    | **Match**      | 0.74        | The transaction was correctly matched, demonstrating the tolerance for small amount differences.                                      |
| **Mismatched Dates**      | **Match**      | 0.79        | The transaction was correctly matched, showing the flexibility of the date matching logic.                                            |
| **Dissimilar Descriptions** | **Match**      | 0.70        | The transaction was matched, but the score was at the minimum threshold. This highlights a weakness in the description similarity algorithm. |
| **One-to-Many Match**     | **No Match**   | N/A         | The system was unable to match the single bank transaction to the two corresponding company entries.                                  |
| **No Match**              | **No Match**   | N/A         | The transaction was correctly left unmatched.                                                                                         |

## 4. Bottleneck Analysis

The primary bottleneck in the reconciliation process is the `find_matches` function in `src/services/reconciliation_service.py`. This function uses a nested loop to compare every bank transaction with every company financial entry, resulting in a time complexity of **O(N \* M)**. This will lead to significant performance issues with large datasets.

## 5. Suggested Improvements

Based on the analysis, the following improvements are recommended:

1.  **Improve Description Similarity:**
    *   Replace the current basic algorithm with a more advanced one like **FuzzyWuzzy** or a **lightweight NLP model** to better handle variations in descriptions.

2.  **Optimize `find_matches` Function:**
    *   Implement **blocking/indexing** by grouping transactions by amount or other criteria to reduce the number of comparisons.
    *   **Pre-sort** both transaction lists by date to limit comparisons to a smaller window of time.

3.  **Handle Complex Matches:**
    *   Develop a feature to handle **one-to-many and many-to-one matches**, either through a manual user interface or a more advanced algorithm that can detect split transactions.

4.  **More Flexible Date Matching:**
    *   Implement a **more granular scoring system for dates**, where the score is inversely proportional to the date difference.

5.  **Improve User Interface:**
    *   Create a **user interface for reviewing and confirming/rejecting matches**, as well as for manually matching transactions. This will provide more control and improve the overall accuracy of the reconciliation process.

## 6. Conclusion

The current reconciliation process provides a good baseline, but there are several areas for improvement. By implementing the suggested changes, the application can become more accurate, efficient, and user-friendly. The most critical improvement is to address the performance bottleneck in the `find_matches` function to ensure the system can handle large volumes of data.
